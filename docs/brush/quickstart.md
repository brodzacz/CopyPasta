# Quick-start
## 1. Wands
1.1 List the available wands:
```
/wand list
```
1.2 Assign a wand to your held item:
```
/wand <wand_name>
```

## 2. Options
2.1 List the available options (for the current wand):
```
/wand options
```
2.2 Set the value for a given option:
```
/set <option_name> <value>
```
2.3 Reset the wand's options to their defaults:
```
/wand reset
```

_CopyPasta stores your custom options so they're ready to use the next time you connect to the server._

## 3. Use
Wands behave in different ways depending on left/right clicks, and if you are sneaking whilst clicking.
