# Cloud
The cloud brush uses a 3D noise algorithm to produce cloud-like blobs of a certain material, varying properties of that
 material such it's opacity or color.

## Actions
### Paste Mode
- Left-click - undo
- Right-click - paste

## Options
- `seed` - the seed for the noise generator
- `frequency` - the rate of height variation
- `scale` - the horizontal scale of the cloud
- `octaves` - the definition in the cloud
- `radius` - the radius of the brush
- `height` - the max height of the brush
- `center` - the size of the lower half of the cloud relative to the overall height
- `feather` - the amount of fade applied to the edges of the brush
- `opacity` - the overall opacity/strength of the brush
- `density` - the balance of cloud material to air in the brush
- `rotation` - the amount of rotation to apply depending on the view direction

The following page demonstrates how the various options work together to produce the cloud.  
The upper image shows a plan-view of the cloud.  
The lower image shows a cross-section of the cloud (taken at the purple line on plan).
